# **THE BOX**

Embrace on a journey with a little red Box, which can move around and sometimes control other similar boxes. Clear the path and reach the end point on every level and try not fall into spikes in the process. 

_There are also some hidden areas in every level, can you find them all?_

## Issues
1. Playing the game without a physical keyboard is not possible at this moment. I will work on touchscreen support once I get some free time.
2. **Level 1: Movement With Box**, has a serious lack of checkpoints for a beginner level, making it extreamly frustrating for new comers who are just learning the movements.
3. **Level 3: Another one**, has some bugs where the camera sticks to the upper part of the screen, instead of following the box. Only way to solve is to restart the level. I am trying to figure out a solution and also working on a complete redesign of the camera mechanics.


## Important Files

- **[Scenes](/Assets/Scenes/)**, contains all the unity scenes for the different levels, some are underdevelopment and some are used to create other scenes

- All the music and sound effects are taken from **[OpenGameArt](http://opengameart.org)**
- The Script **[CharacterController2D.cs](/Assets/Scripts/CharacterController2D.cs)** is taken from **[Brackeys youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA)**. Finetuning a code to make the character move smoothly is just too much of a time consuming job.
- fonts were collected from **[Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com)**
- Other than these, all Scripts, sprites, animations and prefabs were created by me
